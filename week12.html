                             We met Mahfuzul K. from Strathfield Council today to see what he thinks of
                             our current app's UX and UI. Mahfuzul said that the app is good, and that the infringement structure
                             and menu is better than before. He stated that the personal record section is good
                             and that he expected to click on the infringement notice cancellation button if there was a mistake.
                             However, towards the last page of the infringement notice section (the print record), he tried to zoom in, which indicates
                             that the text is small at a first glance. Despite
                             this, he said he was able to read it. <br>
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Reflection</b><br>
                            I think we need to improve the overall aesthetics of our interface to make it
                            look more realistic and professional.   Being a designer has taught me that colour harmony plays an important role in user interface design.
                            With that said, the colour scheme of our current app is
                            not that pleasant and the icons do not seem to go hand-in-hand with each other. <br><br>To improve this,
                            we need to re-evaluate our colour scheme and possibly change the splash screen and the map colour scheme.
                            We need to somehow improve this before we submit our video tomorrow night.

              <div class="week1entry-page" id="showingdiv2"> Last minute filming and redesign
                <br><br>
              <div class="week1entry-write">
                Our group wanted to film the best scenes for our assignment due tonight. To do this, we had
                to meet Mahfuzul once again to shoot a realistic scene of how we hope our rangers would use the app. Despite having a lot of
                bad footage, the filming was quite successful because we got what we needed.<br><br><i>Redesign</i><br>
                 We had to change the colour scheme of our app and add minor details before submission in order
                 for the app to be more appealing and user friendly. This is our most recent app: <br><br>  <img src="./img/process-journal/currentapp.gif" alt="home"><br>
                  <br><br>
                <b>Reflection</b><br><i> Written the day after</i><br>
                The video we submitted yesterday night was not our very best. Unfortunately that night, we had
                a change of mind about how we wanted our final design to look like. We had to reshoot
                the part where we filmed our app interface. Since it was late at night, it was not
                consistent with the lighting throughout the video. That's why the video didn't turn
                out as great as we thought it would be.<br>

                <br>
                Despite this, I learned that for the next video assignment (due next week)
                we need to shoot as much as we can during the daytime because lighting plays
                such a big role. In addition to this, I believe that I need to be more organised in
                scheduling our group meetups.
