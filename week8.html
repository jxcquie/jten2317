                                     We had an interview with a Senior Manager Compliance named Martin Jenner from Burwood
                                     Council on Wednesday the 26th of September 2018. The interview was about an hour
                                     long and had taken place in Burwood Council’s private room. Martin is very
                                     knowledgeable in his field, and it was clear throughout the interview that
                                     he was passionate about our idea and the need to push for innovation and
                                     progress in the parking enforcement area. Our group had learned a lot just
                                     by listening to Martin speak throughout the interview. Martin was kind
                                     enough to let us record the interview, however, we did not take pictures
                                     as we wanted to keep his privacy as well as we wanted to be respectful
                                     during the entire interview.
                                   <br><br>  Essentially, Martin talked about how the current parking
                                   enforcement system is slow and that he believes the only way to efficiently
                                   and effectively improve the system is to entirely get rid of human interaction.
                                   Martin expressed how people are not 100% all the time, therefore, it is difficult
                                   for the current system to be entirely efficient. For example, Martin described
                                   how eight of his officers have to take annual/sick leave which meant that he is
                                   left with only 4 productive months of the year. Similarly, he described that not
                                   every day will be a productive day for the officers as internal and external
                                   matters such as one’s energy levels or hot/cold weather could overall affect their
                                   day on the job. In addition, Martin mentioned about how there are a lot of ethical
                                   issues surrounding parking enforcement officers, as parking officers could be
                                   biased towards certain people just because they know they might get abused, or
                                   that they know someone and will be hesitant to give them a fine even if they have
                                   breached the law. Overall, Martin expressed how there are a lot of issues with
                                   human interaction in the parking enforcement sector and that he believes
                                   autonomous devices/vehicles could incredibly enhance the efficiency and
                                   effectiveness of the workload.

                                       Martin did his masters a few years ago at the University Technology Sydney
                                       (UTS) and had kindly given us his research paper about the issues of
                                       parking enforcement and ultimately how to improve the system.
                                       Our group will read his research paper in our own time and will
                                       consider some of the improvements he suggested to include in our
                                       lo-fi wireframes. We will schedule another meetup next week and
                                       hear what he has to say about our two wireframe concepts.
