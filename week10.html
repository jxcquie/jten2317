                           We had scheduled another meeting with Martin Jenner from Burwood Council on Monday the 8th of October, 2018
                            (yesterday). We were hoping to go out on the streets to ask more officers about our prototypes
                            but Martin was kind enough to introduce us to five rangers from Burwood Council.
                            Their names are Andy Leung, Tai Trish, Anthony Henderson, Steve Winson, and Paul Kuper.<br><br>

                            Sandra, Angie and I conducted Usability Testing and the Think Aloud method when we were evaluating
                            each of our concepts with the officers. After we tested our three concepts, we decided that we want
                            to follow through with Concept 1 -- the mobile app for parking officers.<br><br>
                            The officers were friendly and understanding. When we asked them to try our app, they were very open
                            and willing to try our idea. The officers stated that the app was easy to use and the navigation
                            was simple, however, also stated that they are not able to assess the full extent of our app
                            without trying the app in real life.<br><br>
                            Here is the app that we showed to our participants:<br><br>
                            <img src="./img/process-journal/home.gif" alt="home"><br>
                            <br>

                            <b>Reflection</b><br>
                            It was such a relieving moment when we got 8 officers to test our final concept (Concept 1), as we had been struggling to find officers to test our prototypes. It was also refreshing to know that the hi-fi app we created was easy to navigate around by the officers and that they didn’t have any major usability or interface problems which is what we were aiming for.

              <div class="week7entry-page" id="showingdiv2">Evaluation Report Presentation
                <br><br>
                  <div class="week7entry-write">
                    Today was the day of our evaluation report presentation. We had mixed feelings
                     about our submission: happy that we managed to get 8 officers to test our final
                     prototype, and sad because we knew that we could do a lot better if we had more time.<br>
                     I felt quite intimidated by the presentations that I had seen because of other
                     groups content and visual aesthetic. However, in light of this, I had learned
                     a lot from watching other people’s presentations. <br><br>
                    <ul class="a"><li>Visual communication and aesthetic are the keys to impress
                    <li>Fewer words = your audience can focus on the content you are saying.
                    <li>Be consistent with your structure and with what you are saying
                      <br><br></ul>
                    <b>Reflection</b><br>
                    Sandra and I talked to Hollie after our presentation was over. We expressed
                    how bad we felt as we thought we could not produce a great report. However,
                    after expressing our concerns to Hollie, she reassured us that we were okay
                    and said some positive things about our presentation. We felt somewhat relieved.<br><br>

                    So after observing other people’s presentations and being motivated to do better, I had done some research on UX design process written by Noteworthy’s Journal Blog. There are some key takeaways that I want to include for the next assignment. They are: creating a use case, user flow, information architecture, and UI guideline. I believe that including these four things in our next presentation will further improve one’s understanding of our prototype.
