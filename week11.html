                           Today we discussed with Hollie about how our prototype could improve
                           from the last assessment. Hollie stated that we should think about
                           incorporating other useful features into our app. For example,
                           including a feature where officers can see problem areas in their
                           district, and notifying officers nearby of a breach in parking<br><br>
                            In addition, Hollie mentioned some small interface details that we need to improve on. For example, our menu page was not clear, there was no clear contrast on the screen, and the images need to be more consistent and clear.

                            <b>Reflection</b><br>
                            When we talked to Hollie about our prototype from the last assignment/presentation,
                            Hollie brought to our attention that we did make a hi-fi prototype instead of a
                            low-fi prototype. We were highly aware of this and that we regret not doing
                            things properly and panicking due to the time we had. It was unfortunate
                            that our group were too focused on the evaluation methods instead of the
                            prototype in itself. In the future, we’ll definitely learn to not repeat
                            the same mistakes again. Speaking of not repeating the same mistakes again,
                            we understand that we made the mistake of testing in an office room instead
                            of out in the public. We will definitely test out in the streets for our next
                            assignment to ensure that we replicate our ideal scenario in the real world.

                We started creating our screens for our iteration. After listening to Hollie’s advice on Thursday, we made sure that we had at least 3 clear and distinct features that officers can use. The three features we chose to have are:

                <li>Images that appear more realistic on the app<br><br></li>
              </ul>  <b>Reflection</b><br>
                I believe that our current iteration looks better in terms of the interface and usability. However, I do think that the icons could be more improved to look realistic. In addition, I am not a big fan of the map aesthetic of our current app, I do hope that we improve on the map visuals in our next iteration.
