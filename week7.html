                         Due to the limited amount of time our group has, our group
                         is hoping to interview a few officers/councils so that our
                         group has some form of information to work from. I had
                         contacted several councils yesterday to see whether they
                         could assist our group with the Parking Officer research
                         that we are conducting. So far out of the five emails I
                         had sent, two have responded. The questions I intended to
                         ask are:<br><br><ul class="a">
                           <li>What is the typical day/process of a parking officer?</li><br>
                           <li>What are some of the duties of parking officers?</li><br>
                           <li>What are some of the biggest issues that parking officers experience on patrol duties?</li><br>
                           <li>What are the things that parking officers are doing to make their on-patrol duties easier?</li><br>
                           <li>What tools do parking officers use in their work?</li><br><br>
                         </ul>
   Aside from this, our group has done individual second-hand research to understand the roles
   and duties of parking officers, and the problems they encounter on the job. <br>
   Parking officers ensure that drivers follow local parking laws and issue fines
   for violations. They typically are assigned to a particular geographic area
   (a local council) to patrol and monitor violations such as a no-parking
   zone, 2P, expired meters, and more. They are responsible for preparing
   reports and filing paperwork, and often would have to go to the court to
   present. Aside from this, parking officers do encounter a difficult
   challenge: they are often physically and verbally abused by people.
   <br><br><br>
   <b>Reflection</b>
   <br>
   From our understanding of parking officers, based from our research, we created two ideas that we hope to turn into design concepts using storyboards.

            <div class="week7entry-page" id="showingdiv2">Phone call interview
              <br><br>
                <div class="week7entry-write">
                  I had contacted a Senior Regulatory Officer-Ranger named David M. from Strathfield Council earlier on the week to see if he could help our group with our research. We arranged a phone call interview for Friday the 21st of September, 2018 (which was yesterday) and the phone call interview was approximately 24 minutes long. Our group got to ask all of the questions that we had prepared to ask. Gaby (Gabrielle) was the interviewer of the phone call interview with David, while I was listening next to her, trying to write down notes on my phone. Unfortunately, in this interview we were unable to record our phone call with David because of consent and privacy issues.
                  My quick notes during the phone call interview: (I was unable to record word-to-word)
                  <ul class="a">
                  <li><b>What are the duties of a parking officer?</b> <br>
                    Patrol the streets regarding parking, keep everything within road rules, time parking, patrolling
                  <li><b>What are the strategies/techniques you use for finding parking violators?</b><br>
                    Chalk the tyres for time, record in our notebooks. We use to write in our notebooks but now we use an electronic PDA using the Samsung Note 5 phone version.
                  <li><b>What are some of the difficulties you encounter on the job?</b><br>
                    Weather. If it’s extreme cold or extreme heat. The surface on the ground that we’re walking on/street concrete. Walking up and down the hill. Customers, all types of customers. We get verbal/physical abuse
                  <li><b>What is your typical day/process as a parking officer?</b><br>
                  Walk in, drive in, hop in the car to go to another suburb, there’s a lot of walking. Sometimes there might be a complaint being sent.
                  <li><b>How do you know where to go?</b><br>
                  You have a map, or you know the areas where to go. Health/weather or natural stuff can happen
                  <li><b>Can you tell me more about the PDA?</b><br>
                  It is a program that give prompts. So on the main menu it prompts street/council parking, general council, dog management.<br>
                  Street - issue pin, review, rego<br>
                  What kind of plate: nsw, vic, qld<br>
                  What kind of vehicle it is<br>
                  Offence code: e.g. disobey $230 (can change)<br>
                  Offence time/date: location, street name/suburb<br>
                  Vehicle make: body/sudan/hatch/colour<br>
                  Operational details like client code: a council has a code that relates to the council
                  (for e.g. Strathfield Council has their own for when they lodge to the government)<br>
                  Tickets are printed out of all the details as long as you hit the next page, it prompts you to the next<br>
                  Different signage for different days (it is quite a good system)
                  <li><b>What are your thoughts on autonomous enforcement drones?</b><br>
                  Some councils already use camera cars. I don’t know about the drone idea. I think it’ll be good in the
                  future but for now I think that the community won’t accept it. We already have the parking
                  ticket PDA system. Unless the camera on the drone is so strong and can scan four streets at
                  once or whether it can see behind bushes, I just don’t see the point of having it.<br></ul>
                  <br><br>
                  After the first phone call interview that we did, we wanted to go to
                  Town Hall council to see if we could talk to more officers. When we reached Town Hall
                  council, we saw three parking officers who were on their break. We kindly approached
                  them to see if we could ask them quick questions for our research. They agreed and we
                  were ready to ask our questions. One officer had left so in the end we interviewed
                  two officers: a male officer named Edwin and a female officer named Vicki.
                  Unfortunately again, we couldn’t record or take pictures due to consent and privacy.
                  We had agreed not to record or take pictures of our short interview.
                  I was the interviewer whilst Gaby and Sandra (Jihyun) were recording the answers.

<br><br><br>
<b>Reflection</b>
<br>
Overall, I think we had a successful day. We managed to conduct a phone call interview, as well
as interview two officers that we had just met in Town Hall. We were not expecting any officer
to help us after our phone call interview, but I’m glad that we approached the two parking
officers while they were on their break (they were just sitting down relaxing, so we didn’t
really ruin their break). <br>
In both of the interviews that we did, we asked the officers of what they thought about
autonomous enforcement drones. It seems that they were not on board with the idea of
having drones flying around taking their jobs but I think it is because we failed in
explaining how it could incredibly help them with their work, and not just to solely
take their jobs away from them. Next time, we’ll have a better explanation of what we
are trying to do, with better intentions.
